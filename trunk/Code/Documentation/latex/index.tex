The Light Automation System Accessed Remotely, or L\-A\-S\-A\-R, will allow residents to automate and centrally control the light fixtures and window blinds of a home environment. A remote device will connect and control several satellite units in different rooms, each connected to the light fixtures and window blinds in the room. Sensors built into the satellites will allow the system to monitor current light levels and motion in each room.

The L\-A\-S\-A\-R will replace the current light automation systems and light controls in a household. User-\/determined settings will be used to determine the desired brightness of the rooms at different times of day via the light sensor, along with preferences between artificial and ambient light. A motion sensor will shut off the artificial lights in an unoccupied room to prevent wasted energy. The L\-A\-S\-A\-R will empower a user with total lighting control of a household while minimizing energy wasted on inappropriate lighting.
